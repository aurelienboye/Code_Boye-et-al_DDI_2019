# Code of Boyé et al. 2019 Diversity and distributions

You can find [here](https://aurelienboye.github.io/Code_Boye-et-al_DDI_2019/Boye_etal_2019-DDI.html)  the code used to make the analyses of our article entitled **Trait-based approach to monitoring marine benthic data along 500 km of coastline** published in *Diversity and distributions* in 2019. 

The article is open-access and can be found on the webpage of the journal at [doi:10.1111/ddi.12987](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12987). I also included in this folder a pdf version of the article with the supplementary material. 

Only trait-data are made available in this folder. 

Community data come from the REBENT monitoring programme (http://www.rebent.org) and are available in the Quadrige database (http://envlit.ifremer.fr/resultats/base_de_donnees_quadrige) and in the database of the marine observatory of the IUEM (available upon request: https://www-iuem.univ‐brest.fr/observatoire). The formatted community and environmental data used here are also available upon request [here](https://github.com/aurelienboye/Code_Boye-et-al_DDI_2019/issues) or by email at aurelien.boye(at)ifremer.fr

Note that all figures that do not appear in this document were made on Inkscape. This include :

Some of the figures were also combined on Inkscape, including :
